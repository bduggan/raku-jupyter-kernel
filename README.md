This is a pure Raku implementation of a Raku kernel for Jupyter clients¹.

Jupyter notebooks provide a web-based (or console-based)
Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) for running code and serializing input and output.

REALLY QUICK START
-------------------

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) provides a way to instantly launch a Docker
image and open a notebook².  Click `launch | binder` above
to start this kernel with a sample notebook.  (See below
for similar alternatives.)

QUICK START
-----------

* [Installation](#Installation)
* [Configuration](#Configuration)
* [Running](#Running)

### Installation
You'll need to install zmq.  Note that currently, version 4.1 is
recommended by Net::ZMQ (though 4.2 is installed by, e.g. homebrew).
If you run into stability issues, you may need to downgrade.

```
brew install zmq           # on OS/X
apt-get install libzmq-dev # on Ubuntu
```

You'll also want jupyter, for the front end:

```
pip install jupyter
```

Finally, install `Jupyter::Kernel`:

```
zef install 'Jupyter::Kernel:auth<zef:bduggan>'
```

At the end of the above installation, you'll see the location
of the `bin/` directory which has `jupyter-kernel.raku`.  Make
sure that is in your `PATH`.

### Configuration
#### Server Configuration
To generate a configuration directory, and to install a kernel
config file and icons into the default location:
```
jupyter-kernel.raku --generate-config
```
* Use `--location=XXX` to specify another location.
* Use `--force` to override an existing configuration.

#### Logging
By default a log file `jupyter.log` will be written in the
current directory.  An option `--logfile=XXX` argument can be
added to the argv argument of the server configuration file
(located at `$(jupyter --data)/kernels/raku/kernel.json`)
to change this.

#### Client configuration
The jupyter documentation describes the client configuration.
To start, you can generate files for the notebook or
console clients like this:
```
jupyter notebook --generate-config
jupyter console --generate-config
```
Some suggested configuration changes for the console client:

   * set `kernel_is_complete_timeout` to a high number.  Otherwise,
     if the kernel takes more than 1 second to respond, then from
     then on, the console client uses internal (non-Raku) heuristics
     to guess when a block of code is complete.

   * set `highlighting_style` to `vim`.  This avoids having dark blue
     on a black background in the console client.

### Running
Start the web UI with:
```
jupyter-notebook
Then select New -> Raku.
```

You can also use it in the console like this:
```
jupyter-console --kernel=raku
```

Or make a handy shell alias:

```
alias iraku='jupyter-console --kernel=raku'
```

FEATURES
-----------

* __Autocompletion:__  Typing `[tab]` in the client will send an autocomplete request.  Possible autocompletions are:

  * methods: after a `.` the invocant will be evaluated to find methods

  * set operators: after a ` (`, set operators (unicode and texas) will be shown (note the whitespace before the `(`)).

  * equality/inequality operators: after `=`, ` <`, or ` >`, related operators will be shown.

  * autocompleting ` *` or ` /` will give `×` or `÷` respectively.

  * autocompleting ` **` or a superscript will give you superscripts (for typing exponents).

  * the word 'atomic' autocompletes to the [atomic operators](https://docs.raku.org/type/atomicint#Operators).  (Use `atomic-` or `atom` to get the subroutines with their ASCII names).

  * a colon followed by a sequence of word characters will autocomplete
    to characters whose unicode name contains that string.  Dashes are
    treated as spaces.
    e.g. :straw will find 🍓 ("STRAWBERRY") or 🥤 ("CUP WITH STRAW")  and :smiling-face-with-smiling-eye will find 😊 ("SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES")

* __Keep output:__  All cells are evaluated in item context.  Outputs are then saved to an array
named `$Out`.  You can read from this directly or:

  * via the subroutine `Out` (e.g. `Out[3]`)

  * via an underscore and the output number (e.g. `_3`)

  * for the most recent output: via a plain underscore (`_`).

* __Keep input:__ Similiarly, the input text can be accessed via `In[N]` (e.g. `In[3].EVAL` or `In[3].AST` would eval or produce the ast for a cell)

* __Magics:__  There is some support for jupyter "magics".  If the first line
of a code cell starts with `#%` or `%%`, it may be interpreted as a directive
by the kernel.  See EXAMPLES.  The following magics are supported:

  * `#% javascript`: interpret the cell as javascript; i.e. run it in the browser

  * `#% js`: return the output as javascript

  * `#% > js`: return stdout as javascript

  * `#% html`: return the output as html

  * `#% latex`: return the output as LaTeX.  Use `latex(equation)` to wrap
   the output in `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}`.  (Or replace
   "`equation`" with another string to use something else.)

  * `#% markdown` (or `md`): the output will be interpreted as markdown.
  Note that this is for generating markdown as the output of a cell, not for
  writing markdown, which can be done without magics.  Also, this simply
  sends the data with the markdown mime-type, and the notebook does the rendering.

  * `#% > markdown` (or `md`): interpret stdout as markdown

  * `#% html > latex`: The above can be combined to render, for instance,
  the output cell as HTML, but stdout as LaTeX.   The word before the `>`
  indicates the type of the output cell.  The word after the `>` indictes
  the type of stdout.

  * `%% bash`: Interpret the cell as bash.  stdout becomes the contents of
  the next cell.  Behaves like Raku's built-in `shell`.

  * `%% run FILENAME`: Prepend the contents of FILENAME to the
  contents of the current cell (if any) before execution.
  Note this is different from the built-in `EVALFILE` in that
  if any lexical variables, subroutines, etc. are declared in FILENAME,
  they will become available in the notebook execution context.

  * `%% always [SUBCOMMAND] CODE`: SUBCOMMAND defaults to `prepend` but can be:
    * `prepend`: Prepend each cell by `CODE;\n`
    * `append`: Append `;\nCODE` after each command
    * `clear`: Clear all `always` registered actions
    * `show`: Show `always` registered actions
  You can combine it with another magic. For example:
  `%% always prepend %% run file.raku`

* __Comms:__  Comms allow for asynchronous communication between a notebook
and the kernel.  For an example of using comms, see [this notebook](eg/comms.ipynb)

### Usage notes

* In the console, pressing return will execute the code in a cell.  If you want
a cell to span several lines, put a `\` at the end of the line, like so:

```
In [1]: 42
Out[1]: 42

In [2]: 42 +
Out[2]: Missing required term after infix

In [3]: 42 + \
      : 10 + \
      : 3 + \
      : 12
Out[3]: 67
```

Note that this is not the same as the raku 'unspace' -- a backslash followed
by a newline will be replaced with a newline before the code is executed.  To
create an unspace at the end of the line, you can use two backslashes.
